# CV Site
https://shaydq.eu.pythonanywhere.com/
# About
Project aimed to create a personal website for me that acts like a CV. Made with Python and Django

#Planned features
 * Currently working on a projects section of the site that will give a little more info on each of the projects hosted on GitHub. This will be done using bootstrap containers as well as the standard Admin section of Django. Feature will connect to GitHub webhooks to populate the posts.
 * Adding some previous projects to this site so they are all in one place instead of hosted separately. Plan is for a property web scraper project that is currently a private repo. This webscrapper will search through different property sites in Ireland and allow filtering and display the total results in a single pandas frame
